Summary: We have organized several annual workshops to foster innovation in security education, especially using game-like approaches, including 3GSE in 2014 and 2015.

## 3GSE
With help from USENIX and the community, we held the first ever USENIX Summit on Gaming, Games and Gamification (3GSE) in 2014, as a venue dedicated to game-like approaches in security education. The summit reflected a number of on-going projects and perspectives from the community, everything from video games to hacking competitions.

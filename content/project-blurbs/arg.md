Summary: Alternate Reality Games (ARGs) are story-driven, trans-media art, designed to engage players to collaboratively uncover and interpret fragments of a story, distributed across multiple forms of media, using the “real world” as its platform. We are investigating using ARGs in a classroom setting for teaching computer security concepts.

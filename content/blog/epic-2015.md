We had an awesome time playing [d0x3d!] at CalPoly SLO's [EPIC 2015](https://epic.calpoly.edu/epic-2015/) program with campers each week (Grade 7-9, Grades 10-11, Grade 12). Bright students, really engaged, having fun with a broad range of STEM topics! It was a pleasure getting to talk, play board games, and listen to what they thought about the data they value in their lives.

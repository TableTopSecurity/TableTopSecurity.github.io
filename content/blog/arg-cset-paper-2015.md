Our [experiences on using narrative-driven alternate reality security games](https://www.usenix.org/conference/cset15/workshop-program/presentation/flushman) for first-year CS students will be appearing at the [2015 USENIX Workshop on Cyber Security Experimentation and Test](https://www.usenix.org/conference/cset15/workshop-program) (CSET15).

For a while now, we've been interested in security education with creative and engaging narratives, paired with rabbit-hole/puzzle-like structures. We [wrote a grant about it](http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1419318) and we've been trying out structure and puzzles since then.

Most recently, we got a chance to use some of these exercises described in our paper at EPIC 2015. Below, at the Cal Poly Cyber Lab, we are running through a scaffolded puzzle built around a narrative involving password cracking.
